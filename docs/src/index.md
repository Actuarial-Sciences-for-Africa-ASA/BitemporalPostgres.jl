# BitemporalPostgres.jl
![beware - work in progress](assets/wip.png)
BitemporalPostgres provides an API for application based bitemporal transactions.
These are "long" transactions, with persistent transaction data that is, so they serve as 
basis of workflow management.

For theory behind this, [see](api/theory)

Docs for BitemporalPostgresDDL, the package setting up the postgres schema, can be found [here](https://kaeptenblaubaer.github.io/BitemporalPostgresDDL.jl/dev)
